# How to lead discussion of a research paper

Please try to limit your presentation to five minutes and save the remaining time for discussion.  If you have any questions about the paper, you can ask them after your presentation.  Allow others in the class to ask questions and share their thoughts.

You do not need to submit the presentation.  You will be evaluated on your in-class presentation.

We will give **extra credit** if, before the class in which you lead a discussion, you submit a zoom recording of your practice talk via email or Slack.  We will not grade the practice talk based on quality, but will _only_ verify that it is a genuine attempt to practice for the purpose of ensuring your presentation does not go over five minutes.  You may _optionally_ ask us to provide feedback if it is submitted early enough for us to provide it.

#### For all papers, you should cover:

1.  Who are the authors and why did they decide to research the topic?

2.  What type of paper is it?
      - Qualitative, Quantitative, Survey/SoK, Opinion?
      - Interview, Survey, Field, Lab?

3.  What do the authors claim the results to be and do you believe them?

4.  Was there important information missing or that was hard to understand?

5.  What results did you find most surprising?

#### You may also want to discuss:

-  What were the least believable parts of the paper or sources of skepticism?

-  What were the most clever parts of the paper, or what did the authors do that you would have never thought of?

-  What do you wish the authors had done differently?


#### Other guidelines

- A detailed discussion of all methodology and results would take far more time than you have.  You will need to work hard to identify any unique methodological choices or important results and stick only to those.

- Avoid reading aloud large parts of the paper when you’re doing the discussion. Try instead to describe in your own words the authors’ findings or discussions.  If the paper includes figures or tables, include them in your presentation and tell their story.

- Don’t be afraid to state openly when you don’t understand part of a paper (or even the whole paper\!) It’s very helpful for both the instructors and the rest of the students to know when something is not clear.

- You are unlikely to have time to discuss the related work section, so unless a piece of related work is something we've read in class (e.g., you can save time on discussion methodology by saying a paper uses similar methodology to X et. al) or there's a connection to a paper you're deeply passionate about, you don't need to discuss the section.

- There is a lot of information available on making better presentations, but you can start with [this blog post](https://my.chartered.college/impact_article/using-cognitive-load-theory-to-improve-slideshow-presentations/) and [this paper](https://ojs.library.queensu.ca/index.php/PCEEA/article/view/14872).  Improving your ability to give presentations will also benefit you outside of this course.
