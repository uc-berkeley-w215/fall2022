  - 2: Studying Decision-Making

### Assignments due

1.  Pick a cognitive bias from [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases). Create two slides to present in class that explain the bias and how it might impact usersâ€™ security or privacy behavior (or the study of that behavior).

1.  Please spend a few minutes writing down your thoughts to each of these questions.  For the *first two questions*, create additional slides to share with the class.  These slides should be brief and contain just a few salient examples from your answer.

	1.  > What are some examples of security interfaces that you use in your daily life that lead to irrational behaviors? (You may start with the examples you and your classmates came up with last week.)

	1.  > What specific biases might impact computer security decision-making and how?

	1.  > What sort of problems are IRBs likely to prevent?

	1.  > What problems are they unlikely to prevent?

	1.  > Should private companies use IRBs for their human-subjects research?

Please upload both files (your slides and a PDF of the document where you wrote your answers to the questions above) in slot "*Assignment 2*" in ISVC.

Also: remember to work on your IRB training, due on [Week 4](./schedule/week-04.md).
