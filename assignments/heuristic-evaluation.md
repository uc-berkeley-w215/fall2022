# Heuristic evaluation
Perform a heuristic evaluation of a security feature in your web browser or on a website. You may find useful the classic article on [how to conduct an heuristic evaluation](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-conduct-a-heuristic-evaluation/), by Jakob Nielsen.

1. Choose a set of heuristics. You may pick some or all of [Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/), or Shneiderman's 8 golden rules of interface design (described in Chapter 10 of Lazar's book).
1. Apply those heuristics to a security feature in an application or website, or to a feature that impacts security even though security is not its primary function.
1. Document your results using screenshots of the application or website you are analyzing; if possible, draw over the images to highlight those features that you (or any other evaluators) are focusing on when conducting the evaluation.
1. Provide suggestions on how any potential problems could be improved. *Your suggestion might be a new design, change to a feature, or it might be a suggestion for additional empirical research.*
