# Structure for initial project proposal

*1. Whom do you plan to study? (<= one sentence)*

*2. In one sentence, what is the hypothesis to be tested (comparative study), the behavior to quantify (measurement study), or the exploratory question you would pose to participants (exploratory/qualitative study)?*

*3. In one sentence, explain the potential impacts of your research findings, such as in providing users with better-designed products or more helpful security advice.*

*What additional questions might you ask?  (limit to 3 sentences)*

*What prior work would you be building on and what did you learn from it?*

### Example 1: Comparative

1. Crypto-currency users with digital wallets

2. Do crypto-currency experts use different strategies to protect their digital wallets?

3. If there is evidence to support a gap between experts and non-experts, we could direct research into making the strategies used by experts accessible to all users.

Prior work: Similar to [previous work comparing security strategies of experts to non-experts](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/soups2015/soups15-paper-ion.pdf), we want to compare security strategies of self-reported crypto-currency experts to those with less expertise.

### Example 2: Measurement

1. Crypto-currency users with digital wallets

2. Do you backup your digital master keys to a non-digital medium, such as by printing them on paper or via CryptoSteel?

3. We can identify how many users might be served by technologies that make reading from, or writing to, these non-digital media more sure or reliable.

### Example 3: Exploratory

1. Crypto-currency users with digital wallets

2. What steps do you take to ensure you'll be able to access your digital assets even if you lose one or more of the devices on which you store them?

3. We can direct research to focus on providing users with better protection mechanisms that fit the ways they're already comfortable, or help them overcome the barriers to protection mechanisms with which they are not yet comfortable.

### Example 4: Exploratory

1. Users that have tried out IoT devices in their home

2. Qualitative study - What privacy concerns do people raise for not adopting IoT home devices?

3. This may be important both to design better IoT home devices, and to better cope with users' growing privacy concerns.

Example questions:
- If you previously thought about purchasing an IoT device and decided not to, what were your reasons for deciding not to purchase?
- Did privacy concerns ever factor into your decision to purchase or not purchase an IoT device?  If so, what were your concerns?

### Example 5: Bad example - Seeking confirmation for a specifc idea

1. Crypto-currency users with digital wallets

2. Have you ever tried to use a mnemonic system (such as the major system or person-action-object system) to memorize a digital key?

3. If use of mnemonic systems is not widespread, we could help users protect their digital assets by training them in their use.

Additional questions: If you have used a mnemonic system in the past, how well did the system work for you? If not, what were the biggest problems you ran into?
