# Helping other project teams

Well-intentioned "help" can cause more harm than good if it doesn't anticipate others' needs.

One of the reasons we ask you to help others in this class is because learning how to a helpful collaborator is an important skill.  When helping others, we encourage you to consider the following factors.

## Be available when *others* need you

It is far better to provide a small amount of time when another team needs help than to offer more time when it's convenient for you, but when those you're trying to help are not yet ready to seek or receive feedback.  Do not expect to volunteer, get a help request, and be done in an hour.  

Rather, volunteer early, suggest ways you might be able to help, and do your best to make yourself available when requests come in. Expect that requests will come at times that are not the most convenient for you.

The earlier you volunteer, the more likely it is that the request will come before you (and everyone else) is overwhelmed with your own project.  When you are able to handle a request, reply as soon as possible to set expectations on when you can help.  Even if you expect to respond in just a few minutes, letting the requester know ahead of time might help them to decide what to do next while they wait.

##### Good
  > I have some free time at 10am and need to complete my help requirement.  Is there anything I can do?

##### Better
  > I see your team is working on a survey on eyelash authentication. Let me know if there's any way I can help. I've written a few surveys before and have used qualtrics. I work during the day but I can usually make myself available from 6-11pm PST with a few hours notice. The best way to reach me on short notice during those hours is by text to 595-867-5309.


## Be constructive

It's easy to find language that is hard to understand or find other problems in others' work.  We've all received "help" that makes our goals seem further away when we were hoping it would move us closer.

To make your feedback more constructive, each time you identify a problem you should ask yourself if you have any ideas for solutions, and offer them.

## Be available for follow-ups

Just as your first-draft materials may need iteration to be understood, the folks you're helping may have questions for you.  They may want to better understand a concern, or to share improvements to see if you agree that a solution addresses a problem you have identified.
