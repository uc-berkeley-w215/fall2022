## Expedited Paragraphs
**Request for Expedited Review**
An expedited review procedure consists of a review of research involving human subjects by the IRB Chair, or
by one or more experienced reviewers designated by the Chairperson from among the members of the
committees.
In order to be eligible for expedited review, ALL aspects of the research must include activities that (1) present
no more than minimal risk to human subjects, and (2) involve only procedures included in one or more of the
specific categories listed below.
If requesting Expedited Review, select one or more of the applicable paragraph(s) below.
(DO NOT select any paragraph(s) if your protocol does not qualify for expedited review. Protocols that do not
qualify for expedited review will be reviewed by the full (convened) Committee.)
1. Clinical studies of drugs and medical devices only when conditions (a) and (b) are met.
a) Research on drugs for which an investigational new drug application (21 CFR Part 312) is not
required. (Note: Research on marketed drugs that significantly increases the risks or decreases
the acceptability of the risks associated with the use of the product is not eligible for expedited
review.)
b) Research on medical devices for which
i) an investigational device exemption application (21 CFR Part 812) is not required; or
ii) the medical device is cleared/approved for marketing and the medical device is being used in
accordance with its cleared/approved labeling.

2. Collection of blood samples by finger stick, heel stick, ear stick, or venipuncture as follows:
a) From healthy, non-pregnant adults who weigh at least 110 pounds. For these subjects, the
amounts drawn may not exceed 550 ml in an 8 week period and collection may not occur more
frequently than 2 times per week; or
b) From other adults and children, considering the age, weight, and health of the subjects, the
collection procedure, the amount of blood to be collected, and the frequency with which it will be collected. For these subjects, the amount drawn may not exceed the lesser of 50 ml or 3 ml per kg in an 8 week period and collection may not occur more frequently than 2 times per week.

3. Prospective collection of biological specimen for research purposes by non-invasive means.
Examples:
a) hair and nail clippings in a non-disfiguring manner;
b) deciduous teeth at time of exfoliation or if routine patient care indicates a need for extraction;
c) permanent teeth if routine patient care indicates a need for extraction;
d) excreta and external secretions (including sweat);
e) uncannulated saliva collected either in an unstimulated fashion or stimulated by chewing gumbase
or wax or by applying a dilute citric solution to the tongue;
f) placenta removed at delivery;
g) amniotic fluid obtained at the time of rupture of the membrane prior to or during labor;
h) supra- and subgingival dental plaque and calculus, provided the collection procedure is not more
invasive than routine prophylactic scaling of the teeth and the process is accomplished in
accordance with accepted prophylactic techniques;
i) mucosal and skin cells collected by buccal scraping or swab, skin swab, or mouth
j) sputum collected after saline mist nebulization.

4. Collection of data through non-invasive procedures (not involving general anesthesia or sedation)
routinely employed in clinical practice, excluding procedures involving x rays or microwaves. Where
medical devices are employed, they must be cleared/approved for marketing. (Studies intended to
evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the medical device are not generally eligible for expedited
review, including studies of cleared medical devices for new indications.)
Examples:
a) physical sensors that are applied either to the surface of the body or at a distance and do not
involve input of significant amounts of energy into the subject of an invasion of the subject's
privacy;
b) weighing or testing sensory acuity;
c) magnetic resonance imaging;
d) electrocardiography, electroencephalography, thermography, detection of naturally occurring
radioactivity, electroretinography, ultrasound, diagnostic infrared imaging, doppler blood flow, and
echocardiography;
e) moderate exercise, muscular strength testing, body composition assessment, and flexibility testing
where appropriate given the age, weight, and health of the individual.

5. Research involving materials (data, documents, records, or specimens) that have been collected or
will be collected solely for non-research purposes (such as medical treatment or diagnosis). (NOTE:
Some research in this paragraph may be exempt from the HHS regulations for the protection of
human subjects. 45 CFR 46.101(b)(4). This listing refers only to research that is not exempt.)

6. Collection of data from voice, video, digital, or image recordings made for research purposes.

7. Research on individual or group characteristics or behavior (including, but not limited to, research on perception, cognition, motivation, identity, language, communication, cultural beliefs or practices, and social behavior) or research employing survey, interview, oral history, focus group, program evaluation, human factors evaluation, or quality assurance methodologies. (NOTE: Some research in this category may be exempt.)
8. Continuing review of research previously approved by the convened IRB as follows:
a) Where (i) the research is permanently closed to the enrollment of new subjects; (ii) all subjects
have completed all research-related interventions; and (iii) the research remains active only for
long-term follow-up of subjects; or
b) Where no subjects have been enrolled and no additional risks have been identified; or
c) Where the remaining research activities are limited to data analysis.
9. Continuing review of research, not conducted under an investigational new drug application or
investigational device exemption where categories two (2) through eight (8) do not apply but the IRB has determined and documented at a convened meeting that the research involves no greater than minimal risk and no additional risks have been identified.

#### Potential Financial Conflict of Interest
14. Potential Financial Conflict of Interest
Individuals who have independent roles in projects and who are responsible for the design, analysis, conduct, or reporting of the results of research performed (or to be performed) under a human subjects protocol must disclose whether or not they have a financial interest in or association with the sponsor or the company supplying materials, drugs, or devices for the project. This checklist pertains to the entire project team working under the protocol. Any individual who has a conflict must comply with University regulations and procedures for disclosure of financial conflict of interest. See Conflict of Interest Committee Website for more information. Please answer the following questions: 

Does any member of the project team (defined as UCB or non-UCB personnel working under the protocol) with substantive responsibility for the design, conduct, or reporting of activities under the protocol, or any member of their immediate family (defined as spouse, dependent child, or registered domestic partner) have
any of the following relationships with the non-UC entity financing the research to be done under the protocol or the non-UC entity supplying materials, drugs or devices being tested under the protocol:
1. Positions of management (e.g., board member, scientific advisor, director, officer, partner,
trustee, employee, consultant).
2. Equity interest (e.g., stock, stock options, investment, or other ownership).
3. Rights to a pending patent application or issued patent to any invention(s), or license rights or copyright for software that has a direct relationship to the project proposed.
If the answer to any of the above is Yes, then each individual with any "Yes" response(s) must submit a Human Subjects Financial Conflict of Interest Form DIRECTLY to the Conflict of Interest (COI) Committee for a separate review.
NOTE: When review by the COI Committee is required, CPHS approval or exemption of protocols will be contingent upon the disclosure and resolution of all financial conflicts of interest, as determined by the COI Committee.

15. Informed Consent
Add the consent documents and/or waivers needed for this research using the table at the bottom of the page, including any translated versions. For any translated consent, include an affirmation of the translation's accuracy, indicating who is affirming the accuracy (PI, Co-PI, or Student Investigator), in the Consent/Waiver Description or
in the Attachment section. Describe the consent process and provide justification for any waivers for each consent document, translation, and/or waiver. The various consent/waiver options are described below. Note: DO NOT include child assent documents, parent permission documents or waivers here (these are
addressed in the next section).

Altered and Unsigned Consent - A consent document that has omitted required information and does not include a place for a participant's signature. This means that CPHS is being asked to waive one or more elements of consent in addition to the requirement for documented consent.

Altered Consent Form - A consent form that has omitted required information. This means that the CPHS is asked to waive one or more required elements of informed consent. For example, if the purpose of the study will not be disclosed to participants in order to avoid bias, this option should be selected because disclosure of the "purpose" is a required element of informed consent. The form must include a signature line and date
line for the individual to sign if he or she agrees to participate.

Consent Form - A standard consent document that embodies all of the required information (elements of informed consent) designed to help an individual make an informed decision about whether or not to participate in the research. The form must include a signature line and date line for the individual to sign if he or she agrees to participate. The Consent Form can also be presented as a "short form" document stating that the required elements of informed consent have been presented orally to the participant. When
the short form method is used, a "summary" of the information that is presented to the participant must also be provided for CPHS approval and there must be an impartial witness to the oral presentation. The witness must sign the summary as well as the short form and the participant must sign the summary. The "short form" method may be used in circumstances where oral presentation of consent is preferable or necessary,
e.g., subjects are illiterate in English or their native language.

Consent Waiver - No consent will be sought at all. This means that the CPHS is asked to waive the requirement for informed consent. This option is often appropriate for research that involves use of existing data or samples 

Unsigned Consent - A document that embodies all of the required information (elements of informed consent), but does not include a place for a participant to indicate with a signature that he or she agrees to take part in the research. This means that the CPHS is asked to waive the requirement for documented (signed) consent. For example, if consent will be obtained verbally or using a button on the web, this option should be selected.

#### Child Assent & Parent Permission
16. Child Assent and Parent/Guardian Permission

Add each child assent document, parent/guardian permission document, and/or waiver needed for this research using the table at the bottom of the page, including any translated versions. For any translated consent, include an affirmation of the translation's accuracy, indicating who is affirming the accuracy (PI, Co-PI, or Student Investigator), in the Consent/Waiver Description or in the Attachment section. Describe the consent process and provide justification for any waivers for each consent document, translation, and/or waiver. The various consent/waiver options are described below. 

Altered and Unsigned Parent/Guardian Permission Form - A parent permission document that has omitted
required information (elements) and does not include a place for a parent to indicate with a signature that he or she agrees to permit the child's participation. This means that CPHS is being asked to waive one or more elements of consent in addition to the requirement for documented consent. 

Altered Parent/Guardian Permission Form - A permission form that has omitted required information (elements). This means that the CPHS is asked to waive one or more required elements of informed consent. However, the form must include signature and date lines for the parent(s)/guardian(s) to sign if the
child is permitted to take part in the research.

Assent Document - A form or script of the information that will be conveyed to the child about the study. In general, researchers must obtain the affirmative agreement of children ages seven years and older for their participation. Assent forms should be written at a level understandable to the child. If the study includes a broad age range of children, more than one assent form may be needed (i.e., an assent form suitable for a
15 year old is not usually suitable for a 7 year old child).

Assent Waiver - No child assent will be sought at all. This means that CPHS is asked to waive the
requirement for child assent. Among other circumstances, this option is appropriate when the capability of the child to understand the research is too limited or when the research holds out a prospect of direct benefit that is important to the health or well being of the child.

Parent/Guardian Permission Form - A document that embodies all of the required information (elements of informed consent) designed to help the parent/guardian of a child make an informed decision about whether or not to permit the child's participation in the research. The form must include signature and date lines for the parent(s)/guardian(s) to sign if the child is permitted to take part in the research.

Permission Waiver - No parent/guardian permission will be sought at all. This means that the CPHS is asked to waive the requirement for parent/guardian permission. This option, for example, is often appropriate for research designed to study conditions in children or a study population for which parental permission is not a reasonable requirement to protect the children (e.g., neglected or abused children).

Unsigned Parent/Guardian Permission Form - A parent permission document that embodies all of the required information (elements of informed consent), but does not include a place for a parent to indicate with a signature that he or she agrees to permit the child's participation. This means that the CPHS is asked to waive the requirement for documented (signed) consent.
