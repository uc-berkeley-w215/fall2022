# Projects to gain insights/statistics on question

Q: Why are users not adopting two-factor authentication? (Interview)

Q: Which reasons for not adopting two-factor authentication are most prevalent? (Survey)

Q: What factors do users cite to justify their preferred device-unlock mechanisms: PIN, fingerprint, face recognition, etc.? (Interview or Survey)

Q: What problems will users have performing common tasks for which \[security technology: e.g. DiceKeys\]\] is used? (Lab study with researcher-specified tasks, similar to Whitten & Tygar)

Q: How accurately can users answer questions about the permissions they have given collaborators in \[permission system: e.g., Google Docs, DropBox, OneDrive\]? (Lab study similar to Whitten & Tygar, and later Reeder’s [<span class="underline">thesis</span>](https://www.robreeder.com/pubs/ReederThesis.pdf))

Q: How effective is an app-impersonation attack on the trusted path mechanisms of an operating system: e.g. Android, iOS, Windows, MacOs? (lab or field study in which one app installed by the user renders itself to look like another app installed by the user to trick the user into giving it a permission it shouldn’t have or entering private information such as a password. See Bravo-Lillo et al.’s “Operating System Framed” paper.)

Q: What security and privacy concerns do users cite for not yet having adopted \[IoT technology: e.g. home speaker, lights, etc.\]?

Q: What steps do people in long-distance relationships take to protect their intimate communications: e.g., are they using a separate dedicated device for this communication, being more careful about how they choose vendors, investigating vendors reputations, adding additional network protections? (Interview, or Survey)

Q: What fraction of users who install password managers use a random master password, use a password they've used before, or use a new chosen password (or variant on theme they've used before).

Q: What fraction of users of password managers actually use them to replace replicated passwords from their pre password manager days with random passwords?

# Comparative studies

P: Compare usability of Signal vs. KeyBase or some other secure messaging
tools.
